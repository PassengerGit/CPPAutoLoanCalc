# CPPAutoLoanCalc
Simple C++ calculator to figure out car loans, with interest, down payment, and adding in Pennsylvania's fee for leasing.
You can run this in any online compiler, or compile it yourself in a desktop program for later use, I don't care.
If you want an online compiler, I recommend programiz.com.
